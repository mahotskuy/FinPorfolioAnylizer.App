# This repository is my student work. The purpose of work is creating the application for collecting investment portfolio data and then send it to ChatGPT for analyzation. 

To run this application you need to get API key, create appsettings.development.json file and then specify settings there:
{
  "Settings": {
    "OpenAI": {
      "API_KEY": "Your key"
    }
  },
  "DetailedErrors": true
}
